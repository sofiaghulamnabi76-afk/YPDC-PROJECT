üìä Student Mental Health Analysis

This project analyzes a *Student Mental Health Dataset* using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, Numpy  
It includes *data cleaning, **visualization, and **insights* to understand mental health trends among students.

---

## üìÇ Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about students‚Äô:
- *Gender*
- *Age*
- *Course*
- *Current Year of Study*
- *CGPA*
- *Marital Status*
- *Depression, Anxiety, Panic Attacks*
- *Treatment seeking behavior*

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis  
- Visualize key insights:
  - Gender Distribution
  - Age Distribution
  - Depression, Anxiety, Panic Attack Count
  - Marital Status Pie Chart
  - Correlation Heatmap (Numerical Relationships)
- Learn and apply **.iloc[]** and **.loc[]** for data selection

## üõ† Libraries Used

| Library | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| *Pandas* | Data loading, cleaning, manipulation |
| *Matplotlib* | Basic visualizations (bar charts, histograms, pie charts) |
| *Seaborn* | Advanced, beautiful visualizations (countplots, heatmaps) |
| *Jupyter Notebook* | Interactive environment for step-by-step execution |

Column Name Cleaning:
Removed extra spaces, converted names to lowercase, replaced spaces with _.

Missing Values Handling:
Filled missing values using mode (most frequent value).

Dataset Check:
Verified using df.info() and df.isnull().sum() before and after cleaning.



üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Gender Distribution



Bar chart showing number of male vs female students.




2Ô∏è‚É£ Age Distribution


Histogram + KDE curve to check age spread of students.




3Ô∏è‚É£ Mental Health Insights
Countplots for:

Depression

Anxiety

Panic Attacks

4Ô∏è‚É£ Marital Status
Pie chart showing percentage of married vs unmarried students.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Heatmap
Visual representation of relationships between numerical features.

üîç Using .iloc[] and .loc[]
.iloc[] (Index-Based Selection)
Select data using row/column index numbers.

# Select first 5 rows & first 3 columns
df.iloc[0:5, 0:3]
.loc[] (Label-Based Selection)
Select data using row/column names or conditions.

# Select only Female students with their Age
df.loc[df['choose_your_gender'] == 'Female', ['choose_your_gender', 'age']]

# Create a new column using loc
df.loc[:, 'age_category'] = df['age'].apply(lambda x: 'Teen' if x < 20 else 'Adult')
## Dataset columns
- `Timestamp` ‚Äì Time when the survey was submitted
- `Choose your gender` ‚Äì Gender of the student
- `Age` ‚Äì Age of the student
- `What is your course?` ‚Äì The course or program the student is enrolled in
- `Your current year of Study` ‚Äì Year of study (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd year)
- `What is your CGPA?` ‚Äì Current CGPA of the student
- `Marital status` ‚Äì Marital status of the student
- `Do you have Depression?` ‚Äì Indicates if the student suffers from depression
- `Do you have Anxiety?` ‚Äì Indicates if the student suffers from anxiety
- `Do you have Panic attack?` ‚Äì Indicates if the student experiences panic attacks
- `Did you seek any specialist for a treatment?` ‚Äì Whether the student sought professional help
